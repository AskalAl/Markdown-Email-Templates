Hey Ben,

It was great to have you with us.

Now that you aren’t, there’s a feeling of emptiness in the tribe and everyone can feel it.
But I wanted to know about your feelings.

What happened that made you stop using Zest?

I’m sure your answer will help me improve the product experience for other members like yourself.

Let me know :)

Thanks,
